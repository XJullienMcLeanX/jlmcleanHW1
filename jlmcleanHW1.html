				Hello everyone, my name is Jullien McLean and am currently a Sophomore in the CSCI program here at IUPUI. I have currently not decided by concentration, but am extremely interested in Software Engineering. I would say that my favorite place in the world is somewhere with good company. A boring spot can be a great place if you have a few people to make it interesting. Also, my favorite color is <span>red</span>... Just in case you'd like to know (:
